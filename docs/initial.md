Create documentation so Claude Code context starts up fast and has the context it needs to create this project. Use Project_Description.md as a basis. After you've set up the initial instructions,
start scaffolding the project structure, folders and so on. I prefer the LLM to be concise and write as little comments as possible. I want the LLM to constantly look for improvements but normally
not go bananas and perform a shitload of changes unless I have asked it to. But for the initial setup, you are allowed to set up without my interaction
